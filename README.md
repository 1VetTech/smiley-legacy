Smiley Legacy is a tactical, squad-based sci-fi war game built in Unity, based on the critically raw and emotionally charged novel The Way Forward: Shadows of War. Players command Lieutenant Eric Smiley and his fractured squad as they navigate betrayal, survival, and truth on a war-ravaged Earth—and beyond.
